# JobPaw Scrapping
JobPaw is know as the biggest job board in Haiti. This project is meant to explore the way to scrap data on this site and store them in an excel file.

This project is divided in two parts :

1. [GetLinks](https://github.com/htsull/JobPaw-Scrapping-NLP/blob/main/getLinksScript.py) that scrap the website for the job links.
2. [GetJobDetails](https://github.com/htsull/JobPaw-Scrapping-NLP/blob/main/getJobDetailsScript.py) that use the links scrapped to get teh details of the jobs posted.

Anyone who sees the utility of this script can also use the noteboks associated to adapt them to their needs.
